# **Machine Learning Project: Data Classification with Decision Tree and SVM**

## ** Overview**  
This project demonstrates a comparative study of two popular machine learning algorithms: **Decision Tree** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.  
The algorithms are applied to two distinct datasets to classify data points into predefined categories.  
The project evaluates the performance of these algorithms based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ** Datasets**  

### **1. Marine Fish Dataset**  
- ** Description**: Contains various features of marine fish, such as physical and biological measurements.  
- ** Goal**: Classify fish into different species.  
- ** Target Classes**: Species names such as Cod, Herring, Tuna, etc.

### **2. Seeds Dataset**  
- ** Description**: Includes measurements of wheat kernels, such as area, perimeter, and compactness.  
- ** Goal**: Classify wheat kernels into three seed varieties.  
- ** Target Classes**: Three distinct seed types.

## ** Algorithms Used**  

### **1. Decision Tree Classifier**  
- A non-parametric supervised learning method that creates a tree-like model of decisions.  
- Ideal for interpreting classification boundaries in the data.

### **2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- A robust and efficient supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane for class separation.  
- Performs well with high-dimensional data and clear margin separation.
