"""
Problem:
- Image Prediction with Neural Networks

Program Overview:
This program classifies images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. It involves the following steps:

1. Loading the Fashion-MNIST Dataset:
    - The dataset is loaded and filtered to include specific classes relevant to the classification task.
2. Building and Compiling the CNN Model:
    - The CNN consists of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers for feature extraction and classification.
    - It is compiled using an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics suitable for multiclass classification.
3. Training the Model:
    - The filtered dataset is used to train the CNN.
    - The training process monitors accuracy and loss metrics for evaluation.
4. Saving the Trained Model:
    - The trained model is saved to a file for future use.
5. Preprocessing Custom Images:
    - Custom images are loaded and resized to match the modelâ€™s input requirements.
6. Predicting Classes of Custom Images:
    - The trained model predicts the class of input images.
